# Contributing

This is an incomplete list of things to take care while contributing:
- Every commit message should have this format `$project: title` being `$project` one of `alerts-server`, `alerts-ui` or `root`, see the [commit list](https://github.com/AlexITC/crypto-coin-alerts/commits/master) to get a better idea.
- Try to keep the code style while we integrate a code formatter tool like scalafmt.
- Keep the commits simple to make the reviews easy.
- Avoid merge commits, use rebase instead.
